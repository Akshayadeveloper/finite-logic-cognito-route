<b>Focus:</b> Complex Resource Allocation (Simulated Annealing Heuristic)

<b>FINITE LOGIC: CognitoRoute - Dynamic Resource Scheduler</b>

CognitoRoute uses Simulated Annealing (a powerful metaheuristic) to find near-optimal solutions for highly constrained, non-linear scheduling and resource allocation problems. It is designed to optimize complex cost functions (e.g., minimizing cloud cost while maximizing latency guarantees) where simple greedy algorithms fail.

<b>Solved Problem: </b>

Classic scheduling problems often have too many variables for brute-force or linear programming. CognitoRoute efficiently explores the solution space, avoiding local optima to find the best possible compromise in resource management, achieving greater resource utilization and efficiency.
